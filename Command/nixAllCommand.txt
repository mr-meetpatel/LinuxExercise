=> command 2 : free -g 	-> get free space availabe on server in gb






Q2.During the nginx setup on the server, you have written your own custom config file, now you need to place this file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/ & /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ directories. Also, after you move this config file in relevant directory(s), you also need to make sure that if you update your config file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/
It should get auto updated in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ directory without the need to manually update it.

=> command 1 : cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/		-> navigate to particular directory
=> command 2 : nano myownconfig 			-> create new file.
   [Note : Add some text]
=> command 3 : ln myownconfig /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ -> create hardlink to particular directory
   [Note : This command will also create myownconfig to particular directory with same content]





Q3.You are closely working with a developer to catch an error in the api call, so you are asked to monitor real time access logs of nginx web server, this log file has a huge amount of data which you cannot risk to open all at once which might take time.

=> eg  netstat -lntp | grep ":8080" 		-> it will return the process running on particular port.








Q5. Your server went down & your developer found that a recent commit had a typo in the source code which had put the server down. Now you have to find the number of occurrences of that typo in the source code file without opening the file. Also, find the occurence of that typo with respect to line number of file.

=> command : cat source_file | grep -o "typo" | wc -l 	-> return count of typo in whole file
